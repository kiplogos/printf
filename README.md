The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. A custom _printf() for learning purposes was developed by cohort #0622 students Nixon Kiplogos and Eunice Mwende                                                                                                          
_printf() function format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. These arguments are placed using the percentage '%' operator.
